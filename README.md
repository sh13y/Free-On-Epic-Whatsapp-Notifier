# Free On Epic WhatsApp Notifier

üéÆ **Free On Epic WhatsApp Notifier** is a fun little project that fetches free games from the Epic Games Store and sends notifications to your WhatsApp group using the Green API. Because who doesn't love free games and WhatsApp notifications?

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Free Games**: The script fetches the latest free games from the Epic Games Store.
2. **Send Notifications**: It sends a beautifully crafted message with game details and an image to your WhatsApp group using the Green API.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A WhatsApp account (duh!)
- Green API account (to send WhatsApp messages)

## Code Overview

### `script.py`
